# TodoApp
I hope you had a good day.
<h2>Introduction</h2>
In the first lines, I will take about why this project will help you.

  * I used pure javascript in this project.
  * This project used localStorage to deal with old data than you added and bring it back on window.


<h2>Steps of Solve</h2>
  
  - First, we add a click event to submit then we check if the input is not empty.
  - If the input is not empty we call (pushData) and create an object that has some variables such as id and title completed then we call two functions
  - (addElemToWindow) and (addElemToLocal) first one shows data in the window and the second one add data to localStorage.
  - After we show and save data and return the page we check if localStorage has data that is called (tasks).
  
     -If it has we will use those.
      
     -And if not we will complete it from the first step.
